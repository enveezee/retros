# Gemini's Workspace for RetroOS

This directory contains my work on the RetroOS project. It includes project outlines, notes, and new code.

## Project Goals

The primary goal is to create a lightweight, retro-themed Linux distribution called RetroOS. Key features include:

*   A custom package manager for "retro" content (games, applications).
*   Integration with existing tools like Fieldstation42 for a retro TV experience.
*   A user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of using retro software.
*   Potential for future expansion to other platforms.

## Directory Structure

*   `/backups`: Contains backups of the project at various stages.
*   `/project_outline.md`: A detailed breakdown of the project tasks.
*   `/src`: Will contain the source code for the new components I develop.
