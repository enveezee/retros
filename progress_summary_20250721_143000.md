## Progress Summary (July 21, 2025, 14:30:00)

This session focused on establishing the foundational elements of the RetroOS package manager, `retros`.

1.  **Workspace Initialization:** I began by setting up a dedicated `gemini_workspace` directory, complete with `README.md`, `project_outline.md`, and a `backups` subdirectory to track and secure progress.

2.  **Core `retros` Structure:** I scaffolded the basic Python package for `retros`, including `cli.py` for command-line interaction, `core.py` for central logic, and `package.py` to define the `RetroPackage` class.

3.  **CLI and Package Management Basics:**
    *   I implemented a rudimentary command-line interface using `argparse`, supporting `create`, `install`, and `run` commands.
    *   A `setup.py` file was added to make `retros` installable.
    *   To ensure a clean development environment, I created and utilized a Python virtual environment (`.venv`) for installing `retros` in editable mode.
    *   Initial tests confirmed the CLI's basic functionality.

4.  **Package Creation (`create` command):**
    *   The `RetroPackage.create` method was implemented to generate `.retropack` files (tar.gz archives) from a specified source directory.
    *   Crucially, I integrated the creation of a `metadata.json` file within these archives. This file now stores essential package information like name, version, description, and placeholders for emulator and run commands.

5.  **Package Installation (`install` command):**
    *   The `RetroPackage.install` method was developed to extract `.retropack` archives into a designated `installed_packages` directory, organizing each package within its own subdirectory.

6.  **Package Execution (`run` command):
    *   The `RetroPackage.run` method was implemented to access and display content from the extracted package, including reading the `metadata.json` and a placeholder `game.txt` file.

7.  **Refinement and Debugging:** Throughout the process, I addressed several pathing and attribute-related bugs, particularly concerning the `metadata.json`'s location within the archive and its retrieval during package execution. The `metadata.json` is now correctly placed at the root of the extracted package content.

8.  **Regular Backups:** I've been diligently creating backups of the project at significant development milestones.

**Current State:**
The `retros` CLI now provides a functional foundation for creating, installing, and running retro packages, complete with basic metadata handling. The next steps will involve enhancing the package format, integrating with system-level dependency management, and building a more sophisticated launcher.
